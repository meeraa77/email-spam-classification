## 🚀 Project Overview

Email spam detection is one of the most important applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Spam emails may contain advertisements, phishing links, malicious content, or fraudulent messages that can compromise user security.

This project builds an automated spam classification system capable of classifying emails/messages as:

- ✅ Ham (Legitimate Message)
- ❌ Spam (Unwanted/Malicious Message)

The project includes:
- NLP preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning models
- Streamlit deployment for real-time prediction

## ▶️ Run the Streamlit App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the local URL shown in the terminal to use the email spam classifier.
